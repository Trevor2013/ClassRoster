Background:
This program outputs a class roster given an array of student information.  It also detects invalid email addresses, outputs the average days each student has spent in a course, and provides a list of students in the software degree program.  The program provides functionality to add and remove students from the roster.

Instructions:
In Visual Studio 2019, open the project file ClassRoster.vcxproj.  Hit Ctrl+F5 to run the program.  The program will print out the student data, any invalid email addresses, the average days in course for each program, and each student in the software degree program.  Student A3 is then removed from the class roster.

Future functionality for this program would include allowing user input to add or remove students from the roster, and other data manipulation.
